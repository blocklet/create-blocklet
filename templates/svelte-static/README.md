## Development

1. Make sure you have [@blocklet/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blocklet/cli) installed

   Blocklet needs blocklet server as a dependency. So you need to install it first.  
   `npm install -g @blocklet/cli`  
   See details in [https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/introduction/abtnode-setup#use-the-binary-distribution](https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/introduction/abtnode-setup#use-the-binary-distribution)

2. Init blocklet server & start blocklet server

   Before starting an blocklet server, you need to init blocklet server.  
   `blocklet server init --mode=debug`  
   `blocklet server start`  
   See details in [https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/introduction/abtnode-setup#configure-abt-node](https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/introduction/abtnode-setup#configure-abt-node)

3. Go to the project directory `cd [name]`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
5. Start development server: `blocklet dev`

## Bundle

After developing a blocklet, you may need to bundle it. Use `npm run bundle` command.

## Deploy

- If you want to deploy this blocklet to local blocklet server, you can use `blocklet deploy .blocklet/bundle` command(Make sure the blocklet is bundled before deployment.)
  > Or you can simply use `npm run deploy` command.
- If you want to deploy this blocklet to remote blocklet server, you can use the command below.

  ```shell
  blocklet deploy .blocklet/bundle --endpoint {your blocklet server url} --access-key {blocklet server access key} --access-secret {blocklet server access secret}
  ```

  > Make sure the blocklet is bundled before deployment.

## Upload to blocklet store

- If you want to upload the blocklet to any store for other users to download and use, you can following the following instructions.

  Bump version at first.

  ```shell
  make bump-version
  ```

  Then config blocklet store url.
  You can use those store url in below.

  1. [https://store.blocklet.dev/](https://store.blocklet.dev/)
  2. [https://dev.store.blocklet.dev/](https://dev.store.blocklet.dev/)
  3. A blocklet store started by yourself.
     > Make sure you have installed a `blocklet store` on your own blocklet server. Check it on here: [https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklet/z8ia29UsENBg6tLZUKi2HABj38Cw1LmHZocbQ](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklet/z8ia29UsENBg6tLZUKi2HABj38Cw1LmHZocbQ)

  ```shell
  blocklet config set store {store url}
  ```

  Get a `accessToken` from blocklet store.

  > Why we need a `accessToken`?  
  > A `accessToken` is genrate by blocklet store, which help us upload our blocklet to any store.

  Set `accessToken` to blocklet config

  ```shell
  blocklet config set accessToken {accessToken}
  ```

  Upload a new version to a store.

  > Make sure the blocklet is bundled before upload.

  ```shell
  blocklet upload
  ```

  Or you can simply use `npm run upload` command.

- You also can upload a new version to blocklet store by Github CI.  
  Bump version at first.

  ```shell
  make bump-version
  ```

  Push your code to Github main/master branch, or make a pull request to the main/master branch.  
  The CI workflow will automatically upload a new version to a store.

## Q & A

1. Q: How to change a blocklet's name?

   A: Change the `name` field in the `package.json` file, change the `name` field in the `blocklet.yml` file.

   You can also change the `title` field and `description` field in the `blocklet.yml` file.

   Run `blocklet meta` command, you will get a `did` config, copy the `did` value.

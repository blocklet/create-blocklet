Create Blocklet is an officially supported Blocklet creation tool that allows you to quickly create Blocklets and automatically add them to your project.

## Preparation

You must first have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure the node version is 16.0 or above. (It is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage node versions under mac)

## Scaffolding

First, find a place to create an empty directory.

```shell
mkdir my-blocklet && cd my-blocklet
```

Creating projects with the official tools.

```shell
yarn create blocklet
# Êàñ npx create-blocklet
```

Project creation via `@blocklet/cli` tool

```shell
blocklet create
```

## Installing Dependencies

```

## Launch Project

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open the URL output from the console and you will see the currently launched project.

## Deployment Release

### Bundle

```shell
yarn bundle
```

The build product is generated by default to `.blocklet`

### Deploy

The current deployment supports two forms:

1. directly through the deploy command
2. Deploy by uploading to the Blocklet Store

Before publishing to the Blocklet Store, local validation can be done by deploying to a local Blocklet Server

```shell
yarn deploy
```

After running, you will see the application you just deployed in the list of cornerstone applications in your local Blocklet Server

### Upload

```shell
yarn upload
```

You can use this command to upload this to Blocklet Store, check documentation at [here](https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/store)

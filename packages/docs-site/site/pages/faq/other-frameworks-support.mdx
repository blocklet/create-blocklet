We already have dozens of templates built in, you can found in [here](../available-templates), and are actively expanding the framework templates built into Create Blocklet, so in theory, Blocklet can be used in conjunction with any framework.

If you would like to add a framework to Create Blocklet, please [contact us](https://github.com/blocklet/create-blocklet/issues), or submit your [pull request](https://github.com/blocklet/) directly and we will add it as soon as possible.

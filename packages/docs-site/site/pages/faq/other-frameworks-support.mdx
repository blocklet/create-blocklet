We are actively expanding the Create Blocklet built-in framework template, and in theory, Blocklet can be used in conjunction with any framework.

If you would like to add a framework to Create Blocklet, please [contact us](https://github.com/blocklet/create-blocklet/issues), or submit your [pull request](https://github.com/blocklet/) directly and we will add it as soon as possible.

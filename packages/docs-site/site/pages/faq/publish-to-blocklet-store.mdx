title: How To publish to BLocklet Store
priority: 12

In all templates created using the Create Blocklet tool, the `packages.json` file contains an `upload` command.

For example, in React's templates, the upload command looks like this.

```shell
npm run bundle && blocklet upload .blocklet/release/blocklet.json
```

The above command will first execute `npm run bundle`, a command that will package a project into the required zip file in the Blocklet Store.

Then `blocklet upload xxx` is executed to upload the specified blocklet meta file to the Blocklet Store.

Before executing the `upload` command, you may need to go to the Blocklet Store to request an access key, which can be found [here](https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/en/developer/publish-blocklets)

Notification Service is a service that Blocklet Server provides to Blocklet applications to quickly send notifications to DID Wallet.

You may need to use the Notification Service in the following scenarios.

- Someone has initiated a transfer or gifted an NFT to your DID Wallet and a notification should also be sent to you.
- A notification should also be sent to you when your purchase of an NFT or certificate, etc. succeeds or fails.
- Blocklet applications that want to make an announcement to all users can also use the notification service.

### How do I send a notification to a DID Wallet in Blocklet?

The ability to send notifications is encapsulated in the Blocklet SDK and you can see the details of how to use it via [here](https://docs.arcblock.io/abtnode/zh/developer/blocklet-sdk#notification-sdk)

A full example can also be viewed via this [Notification Demo](https://github.com/blocklet/notification-demo).

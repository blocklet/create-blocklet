            Whether youâ€™re using React or another library, Create React App lets you focus on code, not build tools.

            To create a project called my-app, run this command:
          - name: CodeBlock
            language: shell
            children: npx create-blocklet my-blocklet

        className: font-bold text-4xl
        children: Easy to Maintain

        className: text-xl
        children:
          - !md |

In the root directory of every `Blocklet` application there exists a `blocklet.yml` file, which is the configuration file for the `Blocklet` application, including the project name, version, author, description of the project and other configuration information.

Here's how to define your application by modifying `blocklet.yml`

## Configure the name and description of the blocklet

```shell
title: Example APP
description: Demo blocklet that shows how to configure Blocklet Meta
```

The `Blocklet` name and description are represented by `title` and `description`.

The `title` and `description` will be presented in the page and will be visible to the user.

## Configure the blocklet's logo

> Note: The logo must have the same aspect ratio and be no smaller than 256px \* 256px

```shell
logo: logo.png
```

## Configure blocklet.md file

`blocklet.md` is a file dedicated to describe the `Blocklet` application and will be used as the `Blocklet` application description file after uploading the `Blocklet` to the `blocklet-store`.

## Configure screenshots

`screenshots` is the image folder of the `Blocklet` application, which is used to display in the details page of the `blocklet-store` after uploading to the `blocklet-store`.

We need to configure the `screenshots` field in `blocklet.yml`, specifying the path to the `Blocklet` application's image folder.

```shell
screenshots:
  - 0.png
  - 1.png
  - 2.png
```

A configured `Blocklet` displayed in the `blocklet-store` looks like

![example](./image/example.png)

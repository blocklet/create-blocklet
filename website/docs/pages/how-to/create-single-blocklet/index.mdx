title: How to create a single blocklet?
---

`create-blocklet` supports two creation modes, `create single application` and `combined application` of type `monorepo

## Create the blocklet

It is created by the create-blocklet command. After entering the project name, you can enter the template selection stage, and you can enter keywords to search in this page.

For more information about blocklet templates, please refer to [blocklet type](https://developer.blocklet.io/docs/zh/how-to/create)
! [create-blocklet](. /image/single-blocklet.png)

Next we choose `[static] react` as an example
! [select-blocklet](. /image/select-blocklet.png)
The program will automatically create the directory structure of the corresponding template and install the dependencies according to its prompts to enter the development mode of the project (provided that the [blocklet-server](https://developer.blocklet.io/docs/zh/quick-start/blocklet-server) environment is installed locally).

```shell
cd my-single-blocklet
npm install
blocklet dev
```

## Start the blocklet

If your blocklet dev above is executed successfully, the terminal will output a blocklet's application launch address, and you can see the currently launched blocklet by clicking on it and visiting it in your browser.

! [browser](. /image/browser.png)


## Update and preview the blocklet

At this point your blocklet is in development run mode and you can debug the application in the browser while you develop. Next we modify the code in our project by adding the h2 title `Home Page` to home.jsx, which will automatically change the content on the page after saving

## Bundle and publish the blocklet

When development is complete, your blocklet can be packaged via the `blocklet bundle` command provided in `@blocklet/cli`.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "blocklet dev",
    "eject": "vite eject",
    "serve": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .mjs,.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx",
    "lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix",
    "start": "vite --host",
    "clean": "rm -rf .blocklet",
    "bundle": "npm run clean && vite build && blocklet bundle --zip --create-release",
    "deploy": "npm run bundle && blocklet deploy .blocklet/bundle",
    "upload": "npm run bundle && blocklet upload .blocklet/release/blocklet.json",
    "prepare": "husky install"
  },
```

The project created with the `create-blocklet` tool is automatically configured with the npm script, you just need to run `npm run bundle` to package your blocklet

Next you can upload your `blocklet` to the `blocklet-store` with the `blocklet upload` command , [detailed documentation is here](https://developer.blocklet.io/docs/zh/how-to/publish)

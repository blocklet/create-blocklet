Create Blocklet is an officially supported Blocklet creation tool that allows you to quickly create Blocklets and automatically add them to your project.

## Preparation

You must first have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure the node version is 16.0 or above. (It is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage node versions under mac)

## Scaffolding

Creating projects with the official tools

```shell
yarn create blocklet my-blocklet
# or npm create blocklet my-blocklet
# or pnpm create blocklet my-blocklet
```

Project creation via `@blocklet/cli` tool

```shell
blocklet create my-blocklet
```

## Installing Dependencies

```shell
yarn

yarn install v1.22.19
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...

‚ú®  Done in 0.71s.
```

## Launch Project

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open the URL output from the console and you will see the currently launched project.

## Deployment Release

### Bundle

```shell
yarn bundle
```

Build the application as a code package that can be deployed to the Blocklet Server, or as an application package that can be uploaded to the Blocklet Store. The build product is generated by default to `.blocklet`

### Deploy

The current deployment supports two forms:

1. directly through the deploy command
2. Deploy by uploading to the Blocklet Store

Before publishing to the Blocklet Store, local validation can be done by deploying to a local Blocklet Server

```shell
yarn deploy
```

After running, you will see the application you just deployed in the list of cornerstone applications in your local Blocklet Server

### Upload

```shell
yarn upload
```

You can use this command to upload this to Blocklet Store, check documentation at [here](https://developer.blocklet.io/docs/en/reference/blocklet-cli)

## How the documentation is organized?

A high-level overview of how this documentation is organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a website. Start here if youâ€™re new to Blocklet.
- [Reference guides](/docs/reference/blocklet-structure) contain technical reference for various aspects of Create Blocklet machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](/docs/how-to/create-single-blocklet) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases.

## Error "not found global / buffer / process"

A solution is provided in vite-plugin-blocklet to solve the problem by passing the parameter `disableNodePolyfills: false`.

Full example:
``` js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { createBlockletPlugin } from 'vite-plugin-blocklet';
import svgr from 'vite-plugin-svgr';

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [react(), createBlockletPlugin({ disableNodePolyfills: false }), svgr()],
  };
});

```



## Why isn't GitHub Actions triggering?

If you are using GitHub Actions to implement Blocklet bundle and release workflow, make sure the branch in `.github/workflows/main.yml` matches the default branch of your repository, otherwise GitHub Actions may not be triggered.
